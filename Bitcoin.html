<h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>


<p>Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency, the accounting of internal accounting units of which is provided by a decentralized payment system (there is no internal or external administrator or any of its analogs), operating in a fully automatic mode. By itself, the cryptocurrency does not have any special material or electronic form - it is just a number indicating the amount of data of payment units, which is recorded in the corresponding position of the information packet of the data transfer protocol and is often not even encrypted, like all other information about transactions between system addresses.</p>
<h2>When was Bitcoin created?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.

    It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.
    
    Bitcoin has been praised and criticized. Critics noted its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity used by miners, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several Nobel laureates, have characterized it as a speculative bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.</p>
